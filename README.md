## About

This project was created by Mayer Lench.<br/>
Lets face it, creating SDF projects in NetSuite is a big setup and its painful. Of course its easier once its setup but we humans are lazy and take shortcuts<br/>
This CLI is the result of lots of work and perfecting. This currently is the best way to develop and deploy an SDF project in NetSuite.<br/>  
Hope you enjoy! Dont forget to star the repo and feel free to contribute!
